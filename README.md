# Sorting-Techniques
This project implements code that creates a comparison between 3 different sorting Algorithms:
1. Bulbble sorting algorithm
2. Quick sorting algorithm
3. Counting sorting algorithm
in sorting 3 different types of arrays:
1. Sorted
2. Inversly sorted
3. Shuffelled
and comparing the time taled to sort each array in each algorithm to demonstrate the differece between time taken by each algorithm to highlight the doffrence tof th time complexity between each.
These are all implemented in the test file.
The uploaded file called Sorting implements a GUI version to simulate the sorting operation to visualize the diffrence between the process of sorting of each algorithm.
In addition, there is a pdf file uploaded containing a report of the code to demonstrate the code precisely.
